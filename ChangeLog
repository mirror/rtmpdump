11 Mar 2009, v1.4

- fixed resume bug: when the server switches between audio/video packets and FLV
chunk packets (why should a server want to do that? some actually do!) and rtmpdump 
was invoked with --resume the keyframe check prevented rtmpdump from continuing

- fixed endianness

- added win32 and arm support (you can cross-compile it onto your Windows box
or even PDA)

- removed libboost dependency, written a small parser for rtmp urls, but it is
more of a heuristic one since the rtmp urls can be ambigous in some
circumstances. The best way is to supply all prameters using the override
options like --play, --app, etc.

- fixed stream ids (from XBMC tree)

04 Feb 2009, v1.3d

- fixed missing terminating character in url parsing

19 Jan 2009, v1.3b

- fixed segfault on Mac OS/BSDdue to times(0)

- Makefile rewritten

16 Jan 2009, v1.3a

- fixed a bug introduced in v1.3 (wrong report bytes count), downloads won't
hang anymore

10 Jan 2009, v1.3

- fixed audio only streams (rtmpdump now recognizes the stream and writes a
correct tag, audio, video, audio+video)

- improved resume function to wait till a the seek is executed by the server.
The server might send playback data before seeking, so we ignore up to e.g. 50
frames and keep waiting for a keyframe with a timestamp of zero.

- nevertheless resuming does not always work since the server sometimes
doesn't resend the keyframe, seeking in flash is unreliable

02 Jan 2009, v1.2a

- fixed non-standard rtmp urls (including characters + < > ; )

- added small script get_hulu which can download hulu.com streams (US only)
(many thanks to Richard Ablewhite for the help with hulu.com)

01 Jan 2009, v1.2:

- fixed FLV streams (support for resuming extended)

- fixed hanging download at the end

- several minor bugfixes

- changed parameter behaviour: not supplied parameters are omitted from the
connect packet, --auth is introduced (was automatically obtained from url
before, but it is possible to have an auth in the tcurl/rtmp url only without
an additional encoded string in the connect packet)

28 Dec 2008, v1.1a:

- fixed warnings, added -Wall to Makefile

28 Dec 2008, v1.1:

- fixed stucking downloads (the buffer time is set to the duration now,
  so the server doesn't wait till the buffer is emptied

 - added a --resume option to coninue incomplete downloads

- added support for AMF_DATE (experimental, no stream to test so far)

- fixed AMF parsing and several small bugs (works on 64bit platforms now)

24 Dec 2008, v1.0:

- First release
